Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

每个人都可以复制和分发本许可证文件的逐字不差副本。

Preamble

前言

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.

大多数软件的许可证旨在剥夺您共享和修改软件的自由。相比之下，GNU通用公共许可证旨在保证您共享和修改自由软件的自由—确保软件对所有用户都是自由的。本通用公共许可证适用于大多数自由软件基金会的软件，以及其他任何作者承诺使用本许可证的程序。（其他某些自由软件基金会的软件则适用GNU LGPL）。您也可以将GNU LGPL适用到您的程序上。

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

当我们谈论自由软件时，我们指的是自由，而不是价格。我们的通用公共许可证旨在确保您可以自由地分发自由软件的副本（如果您愿意，也可以为此服务收费），确保您接收到源代码，或者当您需要时能得到源代码，确保您可以修改软件，或者在新的自由程序中使用软件的片段；确保您知悉您可以做这些事情。

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

为了保护您的权利，我们需要做出限制，禁止任何人剥夺您或要求您放弃这些权利。如果您分发软件的副本或修改软件，这些限制将转化为您的某些责任。


For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

例如，如果您分发该程序的副本，无论是免费的或是有偿的，您必须将您所拥有的所有权利授予接收者。您必须确保他们也能接收或者获得源代码。另外您必须向他们展示这些条款，让接收者了解他们的权利。

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

我们通过两个步骤保护您的权利： (1)对软件声明版权保护，(2)根据本许可证，为您提供复制、分发和/或修改软件的法律许可。

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

此外，为了保护每位作者和我们的利益，我们希望每个人都了解，本自由软件不提供任何担保。如果软件经他人修改并被传播，我们希望接收者知道他们所拥有的并非原版软件，这样他人带来的任何问题都不会影响原作者的声誉。

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

最后，任何自由软件都不断受到软件专利的威胁。我们希望避免此类危险，即自由程序的再分发者需要分别获得专利许可，这实际上使程序成为专有程序。为了避免这种情况，我们明确声明，任何专利都必须为了任何人都能自由使用（自由软件）而作出授权，或者不作出任何授权。


The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

以下关于复制、分发和修改的确切条款和条件。

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

复制、分发和修改的条款和条件

0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".

0.本许可证适用于任何程序或其他作品，只要这些程序或作品中包含版权人的声明，说明此程序或作品可根据本通用公共许可证的条款进行分发。下文中的“程序”指的是任何此类的程序或作品，“基于程序的作品”指的是程序或版权法规定的任何衍生作品：即包含程序或部分程序的作品，（包含的程序或部分程序）可以是逐字不差的，也可以是经过修改的和/或经翻译成另一种语言的。(在下文中，“翻译”包括在术语“修改”中，但不受限制)。每个被许可人都被称为“您”。

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

除复制、分发和修改之外的活动不受本许可的约束；不属于本许可证的约束范围。运行程序的行为不受到限制，只有在其内容构成基于程序的作品时（不依赖运行程序生成）程序的输出才受本许可证约束。这是否成立取决于程序的功能。

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

1.您可以通过任何媒介复制和分发您接收到的程序源代码的逐字不差副本，但您必须在每份副本上醒目地、合适地分发适当的版权声明和免责声明；保证所有提及本许可证以及说明不存在任何保证的声明的完整性；并向程序的其他任何接收者随程序提供一份本许可证的副本。

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

您可以对传输副本的实际行为收取费用，您也可以选择为提供担保收取费用。

2.You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

您可以修改您的一份或多份程序或程序的任何部分，从而形成基于本程序的作品，并根据上述第 1 条的条款复制和分发这些修改或作品，但您必须满足以下所有条件：

a)You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

您必须使修改后的文件附带显著的声明，说明您修改了文件以及作出任何修改的日期。

b)You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

如果您分发或出版的任何作品，该作品的全部或部分包含或衍生自本程序或本程序的任何部分，您必须根据本许可证的条款向所有第三方免费授权该作品。

c)If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

如果经修改的程序在运行时通常以交互方式读取指令，当该经修改的程序为了以最常规的方式实现交互性用途启动运行时，您必须使该程序打印或显示一个公告，其中包含一个适当的版权声明和表明没有保证(或者说明您提供了保证)的声明 ，同时告知用户可以根据这些条件再分发程序，以及如何查看本许可证的副本。(例外：如果程序本身是交互式的，但通常不打印此类声明，则您创作的基于程序的作品不需要打印声明)。

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

这些要求适用于经修改的作品整体。如果作品中可识别的部分不是衍生自程序，而且可以合理认为其自身构成独立且单独的作品，那么当您将这些部分作为单独的作品分发时，本许可证及其条款不适用于这些部分。但是，当您将这些部分作为基于本程序的整体作品的一部分进行分发时，该整体作品的分发必须遵守本许可证的条款，本许可证对其他被许可人的许可延伸至整体作品，因此也延伸至作品的每一部分，无论其作者是谁。


Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.

因此，本条的目的不是主张权利或争夺您对完全由您编写的作品的权利；相反，本条的目的是行使权利，控制基于本程序的衍生作品或集合作品的分发。


In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.

此外，仅将非基于本程序的其他作品与本程序 (或基于本程序的作品) 聚合在一个存储空间或分发媒介上并不能将非基于本程序的其他作品纳入本许可证的范围。

3.You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

您可以根据上述第1条和第2条的规定，以目标代码或可执行形式复制和分发本程序 (或第2款所规定的基于本程序的作品)，但您必须满足下列条件之一：

a)Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

随本程序附上完整的对应机器可读源代码，该源代码必须根据上述第1条和第2条的条款在惯常用于软件交互的介质上分发；或者，

b)Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

随本程序附上一份有效期至少为三年的书面要约，向任何第三方提供对应源代码的完整机器可读副本，该副本根据上述第1条和第2条的条款在惯常用于软件交互的介质上进行分发，但收取的费用不得超过您实际进行源代码分发的成本；或

c)Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

随本程序附上您收到的关于分发对应源代码要约的信息。(这种选择只适用于非商业性分发，并且限于您收到符合上述b项规定的程序目标码或可执行形式和要约时)。

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

作品的源代码是指对作品进行修改的首选形式。对于可执行作品，完整的源代码是指其包含的所有模块的所有源代码，任何相关的接口定义文件，以及用于控制可执行文件的编译和安装的脚本。但是，作为一个特殊例外，分发的源代码不需要包括通常与可执行文件运行的操作系统的主要组件（编译器、内核等）一起分发的任何内容（无论是源代码还是二进制形式），除非该组件本身与可执行文件一起分发。

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

如果是通过提供从指定地点复制的形式分发可执行代码或目标代码，那么从同一地点以同样的方式提供源代码的复制也属于源代码的分发，即使第三方并不必须在复制目标代码的同时复制源代码。

4.You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

除非根据本许可证明确规定，您不得复制、修改、分授权或分发本程序。任何不符合本许可证规定的复制、修改、分授权或分发本程序的行为都是无效的，并将自动终止您在本许可证下的权利。但是，根据本许可证从您处获得副本或权利的各方，只要他们仍然完全遵守本许可证的规定，其获得的许可不会终止。

5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.
您无需接受本许可证，因为您尚未签署本许可证。但是，您未获得任何修改或分发本程序或其衍生作品的授权。如果您不接受本许可证，这些行为将被法律禁止。因此，如果您修改或分发本程序 (或任何基于本程序的作品)，即表示您接受本许可证，及其所有关于复制、分发或修改本程序或基于本程序的作品的条款和条件。

6.Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.

每次您再分发程序 (或任何基于程序的作品)，接收者将自动从原始许可人那里获得许可，根据本许可证的条款和条件复制、分发或修改程序。您不得对接收者行使本许可证授予的权利施加任何进一步的限制。您没有要求第三方遵守本许可证的义务。

7.If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

如果由于法院判决或专利侵权指控或任何其他原因（不限于专利问题），您被施加了与本许可证的条款相矛盾的条件（无论是通过法院命令、协议或其他方式），这些条件并不能免除您遵守本许可证条件的义务。如果您不能同时满足您在本许可证下的义务和任何其他相关义务，那么您将无法分发本程序。例如，如果专利许可不允许所有直接或间接通过您接收副本的第三方在无需支付专利许可费的情况下重新分发程序，那么您同时满足专利许可和本许可证的唯一方法就是完全不分发程序。

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

如果本条的任何部分在任何特定情况下被认定为无效或不可执行，其余部分仍然适用，在其他情况中本条仍将作为一个整体适用。

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.

本条的目的不是诱使您侵犯任何专利或其他财产权利声明，或是对任何此类权利声明的有效性提出异议；本条的唯一目的是保护自由软件分发系统的完整性，该系统是通过公共许可证实践实现的。许多人依赖于该系统的一致应用，对通过该系统分发的广泛的软件做出了慷慨的贡献。作者/捐赠者可以自行决定是否愿意通过任何其他系统分发软件，被许可人不能强加这种选择。

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

本条旨在彻底澄清本许可证其余条款的后果。

8.If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

如果程序的分发和/或使用在某些国家受到专利或已版权接口的限制，为程序适用本许可证的原始版权人可以添加一个明确的分发地理限制，将这些国家排除在外，因此仅允许在未被排除的国家中或国家之间进行分发。在这种情况下，本许可证包含该限制，该限制视为本许可证的正文内容。

9.The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

自由软件基金会可能不时发布通用公共许可证的修订版和/或新版本。这些新版本的许可证将秉持相似的精神，但在细节上可能会有所不同，以解决新的问题或关注点。

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

每个版本都有一个不同的版本号。如果程序指定适用某一编号版本的本许可证“以及任何后续版本”，您可以选择遵循该版本或自由软件基金会发布的任何后续版本的条款和条件。如果程序没有指定本许可证的特定版本号，您可以选择适用自由软件基金会发布的任何版本的本许可证。

10.If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

如果您希望将本程序的部分内容合并到其它适用不同分发条件的自由程序中，请写信给作者获得许可。对于自由软件基金会拥有版权的软件，请写信给自由软件基金会；我们有时会对此做出例外处理。我们的决定将遵循两个目标：维护我们自由软件的所有衍生产品的自由地位以及促进软件的共享和再使用。

NO WARRANTY

无保证

11.BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

由于本程序是免费授权的，因此在适用法律允许的范围内，不提供任何担保。除非另有书面说明，否则版权人和/或其他方“按原样”提供本程序，不提供任何明示或暗示的保证，包括但不限于对适销性和特定用途适用性的暗示保证。程序质量和性能的全部风险由您承担。如果程序被证明有缺陷，您将承担所有必要的服务、维修或纠正的费用。

12.IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

除非适用法律要求或经过书面同意，否则在任何情况下，任何版权人，或根据上述许可修改和/或重新分发程序的任何其他方，都不对您的损失负责，包括任何因使用或无法使用程序而造成的一般的、特殊的、附带的或继发的损失（包括但不限于数据丢失或数据不准确，或您或第三方遭受的损失，或程序无法与任何其他程序一起运行），即使该版权人或其他方已被告知可能发生此类损害。

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

条件与条款至此结束



How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

如何将这些条款适用于您的新程序

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

如果您开发了一个新的程序，并希望它尽可能地为公众所用，最好的办法就是使它成为自由软件，每个人都可以根据这些条款再发布和修改它。

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

为此，请在程序中附加以下声明。最安全的做法是将它们附在每个源文件的开头，以便最有效地传达免责声明；每个文件至少要有“版权”行和一个指向完整声明的指针。

one line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does.
一行给出程序的名称和它的功能。

Copyright (C) yyyy  name of author

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License
as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2
of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

本程序是自由软件；您可以根据自由软件基金会发布的GNU GPL再分发和/或修改它。
或（由您选择）适用GNU GPL的任何后续版本。

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
GNU General Public License for more details.

分发本程序是希望它能够有用，但不作任何保证；甚至不对适销性或特定用途适用性作出默示保证。请参阅 GNU 通用公共许可证获得更多详情。

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA.
您在接收本程序的同时应收到一份GNU 通用公共许可证的副本。如无，请致信 Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA.

此外，请附上能够通过电子邮件或纸质邮件与您取得联系的信息。

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
如果程序是交互式的，当程序以交互模式启动时，应输出如下简短声明：

Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
type `show w'.  This is free software, and you are welcome
to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' 
for details.

Gnomovision不提供任何保证；请输入“show w”获得更多信息。此程序为自由软件，您可以根据特定条件进行再分发；输入“show c”获得更多信息。

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
推定指令“show w”和“show c”能够显示通用公共许可证的特定对应部分。当然，您也可以使用“show w”和“show c”以外的指令来实现。您可以用适合您的程序的任意方式，甚至可以是点击鼠标或是菜单选项，来实现此功能。

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
如有需要，您应该使您的雇主（您是程序员时）或您的学校（如有）签署该程序的“版权放弃声明”。模板如下；请修改名称：

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License.

本通用许可证不允许将您的程序并入任何专有程序内。如果您的程序是子程序库，更优的做法是将专有应用与库进行链接。如果这是您追求的，请使用GNU 宽松通用公共许可证而不是本许可证。
