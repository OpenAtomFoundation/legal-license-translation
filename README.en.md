The "YUANYISHI” Translation Program for Open Source Licenses

Background

While most open source licenses are only available in English and professional legal language, the Mulan Licenses have become the only exception with both English and Chinese versions available. Native Chinese developers continue to face a language barrier in understanding and using open source licenses properly in the absence of an approved Chinese version. In the name of OpenAtom, this translation program intends to publish reliable Chinese versions of open source licenses through open discussion and expert reviews, in order to make it easier for native Chinese developers to understand. We invite submissions from students, corporate developers, individual developers, and anyone else interested in open source culture. 


Goal

To provide reliable and publicly available Chinese versions of open source licenses for developers.

Translation Review

The expert panel will start the translation review for the License of which there are five translation submited. The review will be postponed appropriately if a license has less than five submissions. New submissions within one month after the deadline for licenses that have already had five submissions will still be accepted. However, any translation submitted beyond one month after the deadline will be rejected. One month after the deadline, if there are still less than five submissions for a license, the evaluation will be suspended.

The translation with the most votes will be chosen as the draft for the final version by the expert panel. The translation will be made available to the public for at least two weeks in order to gather community comments and suggestions, which will then be sent to the expert panel via emails, WeChat group chats, and online meetings for further review and revision. The final version will be released and contributed to the public domain under the Creative Commons Zero License.
