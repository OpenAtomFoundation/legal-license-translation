# Contransus | Welcome to submit your Chinese Translations for Open Source LICENSE! 



The "Contransus" (源译识) Translation Project, initiated by the OpenAtom Foundation, **aims to build open source consensus via translation**, in the hope of developing a widerly-shared open source ecosystem. This project is launched to promote a better understanding of open source by offering professionally-reviewed, publicly available and community-oriented translations of various open source resources, primarily into Chinese. The project focuses on not only the **translation of open-source licenses**, but also of **open-source-related judgments, books, key reports, etc**.

**Through the [Project Repository](https://atomgit.com/OpenAtomFoundation/translation), you are warmly welcome to participate in the Contransus Project** by using approved translations, filing your translation, sharing your opinion on any translation texts, as well as recommending useful resources and experts in open source domain. If you have any feedback or suggestions, please feel free to contact us via legal[at]openatom.org.


## Review Panel of Experts (yr 2023)

We established a Review Panel of experts in regard to both open source and languages, including **Professor ZHOU Minghui** (CS professor of Peking University, leading the OSI-approved Mulan PSLv2, etc.), **WEI Sir** (translator of _the Cathedral and the Bazaar_ and various OS licenses), **SHEN Fen** (top open source legal counsel from Huawei and a recognized legal expert in OS community), **Professor SONG Lei** (the chief editor of the English-Chinese Dictionary of Law Terms), and **Professor XU Meiling** (assistant professor on intellectual property law from UIBE). The panel has been working collaboratively in reviewing and revising candidate translation texts line by line to develop a finalized version of translation. 

## Review Process and Roadmap

The experts will organise the review meeting(s) for the License for which at least three translations are submitted. The panel votes to **a candidate translation text** first, reviews and revises it line by line. After publishing in the community for at least one month and incorporating any changes after feedback (you can do this from the Issue or directly email to Translation@openatom.io) or inquiries made to the steward(s) of the OS license, **the revised text** becomes the **finalized text** shared under CC0. Although the review meetings are NOT open to the public, we publish the minutes to reflect all our discussions and explanations, as well as to follow up on the enquiries.

We also set up a review roadmap to further the translation. We encourage you to adjust your submission timeline in accordance with this review plan. 
- 2023 Q1-Q2：**permissive licenses**
- 2023 Q3-Q4：**copyleft licenses**
- 2024 Q1-Q2：**specificial purposes licenses**
- 2024 Q3-Q4：**special jurisdiction and minority language licenses.**

Currently, the experts have reviewed the following [open source license translations](https://atomgit.com/OpenAtomFoundation/translation/tree/master/%E8%AE%B8%E5%8F%AF%E8%AF%81%E7%BF%BB%E8%AF%91) and made them publicly available:
