# Contransus™ | Welcome submit your Chinese Translations for Open Source LICENSE! 



The "Contransus" (源译识) Translation Project, initiated by the OpenAtom Foundation, **aims to build open source consensus via translation**, in the hope of developing a widerly-shared open source ecosystem. This project is launched to promote better understanding of open source by offering professionally-reviewed, publicly available and community-oriented translations of various open source resources, primarily into Chinese. The project focuses on not only **translation of open-source licenses**, but also of **open-source-related judgments, books, key reports, etc**.

**Through the [Project Repository](https://atomgit.com/OpenAtomFoundation/translation), you are warmly welcome to participate in the Contransus Project** by using approved translations, filing your translation, sharing your opinion on any translation texts, as well as recommending useful resources and expert in open source domain. If you have any feedback or suggestions, please feel free to contact us via legal[at]openatom.org.


## Translations of Open Source Licenses

The reason why we initiated the open-source licenses section (this “Section”) is that while most open source licenses are only available in English and even in professional legal language, native Chinese developers are continue to meet the language barrier in understanding and using open source licenses properly. Aiming to provide a permanent and reliable Chinese translation of open-source licenses that is accessible to everyone, this Section are open to community for contributions and discussions.


## Review Panel of Experts (2023 yr)

We established a Review Panel of experts in regard to both open source and languages, including **Professor ZHOU Minghui** (professor of Peking University, leading the OSI-approved Mulan PSLv2, etc.), **WEI Sir** (translator of _the Cathedral and the Bazaar_ and various OS licenses), **SHEN Fen** (top open source legal counsel from Huawei and a recognized legal expert in OS community), **Professor SONG Lei** (the chief editor of the English-Chinese Dictionary of Law Terms), and **Professor XU Meiling** (assistant professor on intellectual property law from UIBE). The panel has been working collaboratively in reviewing and revising candidate translation texts line by line to develop a finalized version of translation.

## Review Process and Roadmap

The experts will organise the review meeting(s) for the License of which there are at least five translations submitted. The panel votes to an candidate translation texts firstly, reviews and revises it line by line then. After published in the community at least one month to gather any suggestions (if any), the revised text becomes the finalized version shared under CC0.
