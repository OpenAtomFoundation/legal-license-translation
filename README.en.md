# Welcome submit your Chinese Translation for Open Source LICENSE! 

## Background

While most open source licenses are only available in English and professional legal language, the Mulan Licenses have become the only exception with both English and Chinese versions available. Native Chinese developers continue to face a language barrier in understanding and using open source licenses properly in the absence of an approved Chinese version. In the name of OpenAtom Foundation, the "YuanYiShi"(源译识) translation program, which means to find the consensus for Open Source by co-translating, intends to publish reliable Chinese versions of open source licenses through open discussion and expert reviews, in order to make it easier for native Chinese developers to understand. We invite submissions from students, corporate developers, individual developers, and anyone else interested in open source. 


## Goal

To provide reliable and publicly available Chinese versions of open source licenses for developers.

## Translation Review

The expert panel will start the translation review for the License of which there are five translations submitted. The review will be postponed appropriately if a license has less than five submissions. New submissions within one month after the deadline for licenses that have already had five submissions will still be accepted. However, any translation submitted beyond one month after the deadline will be rejected. One month after the deadline, the review will be suspended if there are still less than five submissions for a license.

The translation with the most votes will be chosen as the draft for the final version by the expert panel. The translation will be made available to the public for at least two weeks to gather comments and suggestions from public, which will then be sent to the expert panel via emails, WeChat group chats, and online meetings for further review and revision. The final version will be released and contributed to the public domain under the Creative Commons Zero License (CC0).

_For any suggestions or questions concerning the submission or the review, please contact us at Translation@openatom.io. Thank you!_
